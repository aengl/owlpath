It sometimes feels like my memory is shorter than a cut bonsai. Even though
watching anime has become one of our favorite pasttimes nowadays, every time I
want to share some Anime recommendations I find myself with a complete blank.
Emptier than Shorty's üê∂ belly when the door to the kitchen opens.

So I'm writing this post as much as a message to you, as well as a personal
reminder of the anime that we've watched and loved. It's not really meant as a
review list of our favorite anime, but rather a list of our personal
recommendations that you can watch if you find yourself in need of random
entertainment

### My Love Story!!
*Slice of Life | Romance*

If you ever find yourself in a need for a pick me up, this anime is going to do
the trick. It's so uplifting and sweet, it's addictive to watch.
Also, rather short, with 2 seasons it's perfect for 2 days of non-stop anime
goodness.

It's just like an excellent cake, you shouldn't overdo it, but man are those
moments when you indulge to be enjoyed! üòäDon't let yourself be put off by the
cheesy title, the anime is a lot more than it looks like.

### March comes in like a lion
*Slice of Life | Shogi*

I find it fascinating how anime can take some of the most boring sounding
subjects you can think of ([Sh≈çgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi) in this
case - kind of, sort of, similar to chess in very broad terms)) and turn them
into my absolute favorite anime ‚ô•.

### Shokugeki no Souma
*Cooking*

Speaking of anime centered around seemingly boring subjects that are turned
into masterpieces of entertainment, Shokugeki no Souma turns cooking into
the best movie watching experience ever. Prepare to be dazzled, bring tacos üåÆ.

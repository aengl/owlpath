Ever since moving away from Sweden to experiment with life as a Digital Hobo, people have frequently asked us how things are working out for us. Which is great! 🧡

So we decided to jump on the social media bandwagon to keep everyone up-to-date. Which was not so great.

Since we're all busy as hell, let me get straight to the point: social media isn't really cutting it for us. It's impersonal, intrusive, but most of all it doesn't encourage dialog: we went from people asking us, to people reading our feed and not talking to us at all anymore. 😱

So this is how we envision social media done properly: rather than getting hammered with updates, whenever you think of us and are curious where we are and what we're doing, fire up your browser and get a little sneak-peek here.

See something you're actually interested in? Now you have the perfect excuse to chat us up on Telegram, Discord, Slack, wherever. You know where to find us.

We hereby proudly present to you something ancient: an actual personal website. 🎁
